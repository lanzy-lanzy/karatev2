## Score Weights Explained

Why does Sparring count more than others?

```
Sparring (20%) ► MOST IMPORTANT - combat/fighting skills
Attendance (10%) ► Shows reliability and commitment
Achievement (10%) ► Accomplishments and goals
Performance (10%) ► Overall skill and effort
```

**Example calculation:**
```
If you score:
- Attendance: 85 → counts as 8.5 points (85 × 10%)
- Sparring: 90 → counts as 18 points (90 × 20%)  ← Counts double!
- Achievement: 80 → counts as 8 points (80 × 10%)
- Performance: 88 → counts as 8.8 points (88 × 10%)

TOTAL = 8.5 + 18 + 8 + 8.8 = 43 POINTS
```
